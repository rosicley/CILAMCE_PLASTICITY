Abstract: In this work, we propose a numerical formulation based on Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) for solving two-dimensional problems of elasto-plastic solids at large displacements and small/moderate strains. The Isogeometric Analysis aims to connect CAD (Computer Aided Design) concepts with the structural analysis method. In this work, we employ basis functions generated from NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) to construct the initial and also the final domains. The current positions are taken as main variables, so that the problem is naturally under the isoparametric idea and also naturally considers geometric nonlinearities. The von Mises criteria is employed to detect plasticity occurrence and an additive elastic-plastic strains decomposition is adopted to represent the elastic-plastic constitutive models. Finally, two-dimensional numerical examples are simulated considering plane strain, in order to verify the proposed methodology.
