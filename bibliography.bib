abstract = {In this study we apply the total Lagrangian formulation based on positions to develop a strategy for the physical and geometrical nonlinear analysis of plane structures and mechanisms. The developed frame elements have cross sections constituted by laminas of different materials and widths. The Reissner–Mindlin kinematics is adopted to include shear effects into the formulation. These elements are connected among each other by semi-rigid connections. Both elements and connections have multi-linear elastoplastic behavior with isotropic hardening. An alternative flow direction rule, which allows the reproduction of any stress–strain curve and the determination of closed solution for the plastic multiplier, is shown. All steps to reproduce the formulation are provided. Various examples are used to demonstrate the good behavior of the formulation, including a progressive collapse analysis of a tall building subjected to a real seismic load.}

abstract = {In this work, we propose a new enhancement strategy that can be applied to the calculated strain field in the analyses of shells by the unconstrained-vector finite element approach, a Solid-Shell-like formulation. This new enhancement is proposed to satisfy the continuity of the shear and normal stresses fields in the transverse direction. The kinematic enhancement is based on the in-plane longitudinal stress equilibrium that is associated with maintaining the elastic strain energy potential in the transverse direction of the shell or plate. No additional degrees of freedom are introduced, and a coherent continuous stress distribution is achieved from the enhanced strain field. Moreover, in contrast to typical elastoplastic procedures, we propose an alternative plastic flow rule, which includes a new concept of the hardening parameter that depends on the orthotropic directions of the material and a general failure surface that degenerates into the von-Mises or Drucker−Prager criteria for isotropic materials. The resulting alternative position-based finite element and the enhanced field strategies are tested for elastic and elastoplastic situations by comparing the results with other solutions and known benchmarks.}

abstract={This work presents an alternative finite element shell formulation based on non-conventional nodal parameters. The considered parameters are nodal positions (not displacements) and generalized vector components that comprise both director cossines and shell thickness variation at the same time. Although any objective strain measure could be adopted to develop the proposed formulation, non-linear engineering strain is chosen in order to take advantage of well know linear engineering stress--strain relations and to complement the easy geometrical appeal of positional formulation. The resulting formulation presents six degrees of freedom by each node and considers constant thickness variation. Consequently, the formulation fulfills a three dimensional compatible mapping and requires a relaxed three-dimensional constitutive relation to avoid thickness locking. Curved triangular elements with cubic approximation are adopted following a very simple notation. Several numerical simulations illustrate and confirm the accuracy and applicability of the proposed formulation.},

High order curved elements with any cross section are developed using a full three-dimensional constitutive elastic relation. Warping and variable thickness strain modes are introduced to avoid locking. The warping mode is solved numerically in FEM pre-processing computational code, which is coupled to the main program. The extra calculations are relatively small when the number of finite elements, with the same cross section, increases. The warping mode is based on a 2D free torsion (Saint–Venant) problem that considers inhomogeneous material. A scheme that automatically generates shape functions and its derivatives allow the use of any degree of approximation for the developed frame element. General examples are solved to check the objectivity, path independence, locking free behavior, generality and accuracy of the proposed formulation.}

The approach exploits the higher order interelement continuity property of nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS), in particular the higher accuracy that results for the stress prediction, which yields an improved estimate for the direction of crack propagation compared to customary Lagrangian interpolations. Shifting is used to ensure compatibility with the surrounding discretization, where, different from extended finite element methods, the affected elements stretch over several rows perpendicular to the crack path. To avoid fine meshes around the crack tip in case of cohesive fracture, a blending function is used in the extension direction of the crack path. To comply with standard finite element data structures, Bézier extraction is used. The absence of the Kronecker-delta property in the higher order interpolations of isogeometric analysis impedes the enrichment scheme and compatibility enforcement. These issues are studied comprehensively at the hand of several examples, while crack propagation analyses show the viability of the approach.},

The extended isogeometric analysis is capable of an efficient analysis of general crack problems using nonuniform rational B-splines as basis functions for both the solution field approximation and the geometric description, and it can reproduce crack tip singular fields and discontinuity across a crack. IGA has attracted a lot of interest for solving different types of engineering problems and is now further extended for the analysis of crack stability and propagation in two-dimensional isotropic media. Concepts of the extended FEM are used in IGA to avoid the necessity of remeshing in crack propagation problems and to increase the solution accuracy around the crack tip. Crack discontinuity is represented by the Heaviside function and isotropic analytical displacement fields near a crack tip are reproduced by means of the crack tip enrichment functions. Also, the Lagrange multiplier method is used to impose essential boundary conditions. Moreover, the subtriangles technique is utilized for improving the accuracy of integration by the Gauss quadrature rule. Several two-dimensional static and quasi-static crack propagation problems are solved to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method and the results of mixed-mode stress intensity factors are compared with analytical and extended FEM results.

abstract = {Abstract A novel domain decomposition approach for the parallel finite element solution of equilibrium equations is presented. The spatial domain is partitioned into a set of totally disconnected subdomains, each assigned to an individual processor. Lagrange multipliers are introduced to enforce compatibility at the interface nodes. In the static case, each floating subdomain induces a local singularity that is resolved in two phases. First, the rigid body modes are eliminated in parallel from each local problem and a direct scheme is applied concurrently to all subdomains in order to recover each partial local solution. Next, the contributions of these modes are related to the Lagrange multipliers through an orthogonality condition. A parallel conjugate projected gradient algorithm is developed for the solution of the coupled system of local rigid modes components and Lagrange multipliers, which completes the solution of the problem. When implemented on local memory multiprocessors, this proposed method of tearing and interconnecting requires less interprocessor communications than the classical method of substructuring. It is also suitable for parallel/vector computers with shared memory. Moreover, unlike parallel direct solvers, it exhibits a degree of parallelism that is not limited by the bandwidth of the finite element system of equations.},

All these methods are investigated on problems of linear elasticity and eigenfrequency analysis in 2D. In particular, focus is put on non-uniform rational B-spline patches which join nonconformingly along their common interface. Thus, the application of isogeometric analysis is extended to multi-patches, which can have an arbitrary parametrization on the adjacent edges. Moreover, it has been shown that the unique properties provided by isogeometric analysis, that is, high-order functions and smoothness across the element boundaries, carry over for the analysis of multiple domains.

The theory can be developed either by utilizing Betti's law or the weighted residual method, or directly resorting to physical meaning, as in the potential theory. To show that the results of the derivations are consistent with one another, we also prove four lemmas of the properties of the kernel functions. The derivations are continued by applying two commutative operations, traction and trace, leading naturally to the concept of Hadamard principal value. Consequently, singularity, often present in problems involving geometry degeneracy, causes no particular difficulties. Finally, we employ two examples to demonstrate the usefulness of the resulting dual boundary integral equations in both analytical and numerical solution procedures. }

The description of the geometry and numerical model of the problem consists only of a set of nodes and a description of exterior boundaries and interior boundaries from any cracks. This makes the method particularly attractive for growing crack problems, since only minimal remeshing is needed to follow crack growth. In moving least-square interpolants, the dependent variable at any point is obtained by minimizing a function in terms of the nodal values of the dependent variable in the domain of influence of the point. Numerical examples involving fatigue crack growth and dynamic crack propagation are presented to illustrate the performance and potential of this method."

In this manuscript, through a self-contained Matlab® implementation, we present an introduction to IGA applied to simple analysis problems and the related computer implementation aspects. Furthermore, implementation of the extended IGA which incorporates enrichment functions through the partition of unity method (PUM) is also presented, where several examples for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional fracture are illustrated. We also describe the use of IGA in the context of strong-form (collocation) formulations, which has been an area of research interest due to the potential for significant efficiency gains offered by these methods. The code which accompanies the present paper can be applied to one, two and three-dimensional problems for linear elasticity, linear elastic fracture mechanics, structural mechanics (beams/plates/shells including large displacements and rotations) and Poisson problems with or without enrichment. The Bézier extraction concept that allows the FE analysis to be performed efficiently on T-spline geometries is also incorporated.

The second presented BEM formulation to analyse crack growth problems is an implicit technique based on the use of a consistent tangent operator. This formulation is accurate, stable and always requires much less iterations to reach the equilibrium within a given load increment in comparison with the classical approach.

abstract = {This paper proposes a boundary element method (BEM) model that is used for the analysis of multiple random crack growth by considering linear elastic fracture mechanics problems and structures subjected to fatigue. The formulation presented in this paper is based on the dual boundary element method, in which singular and hyper-singular integral equations are used. This technique avoids singularities of the resulting algebraic system of equations, despite the fact that the collocation points coincide for the two opposite crack faces. In fracture mechanics analyses, the displacement correlation technique is applied to evaluate stress intensity factors. The maximum circumferential stress theory is used to evaluate the propagation angle and the effective stress intensity factor. The fatigue model uses Paris’ law to predict structural life. Examples of simple and multi-fractured structures loaded until rupture are considered. These analyses demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model. In addition, the results indicate that this formulation is accurate and can model localisation and coalescence phenomena.}

abstract = {Fracture mechanics and crack propagation problems have been widely studied by the scientific community in recent years, because crack growth phenomenon can explain the failure of structures. In order to model accurately the structural behaviour of complex engineering structures numerical techniques are required. In this regard, the boundary element method (BEM) has been widely used to solve complex engineering problems, especially those where its mesh dimension reduction includes advantages on the modelling. This paper addresses the analysis of crack propagation in quasi-brittle materials using an alternative BEM formulation. In this type of problem, the damaged zone ahead the crack tip is modelled based on the fictitious crack model. Therefore, the residual resistance of the damaged zone is represented by cohesive stresses, which tends to close the crack faces. The alternative BEM formulation proposed aims at modelling the cohesive stresses using the domain term of the direct integral representation. This term is degenerated, in order to be non null only at the fictitious crack path. As a result of the domain term manipulation, appears a dipole of stresses, which will govern the cohesive stresses. It leads a nonlinear formulation, where the cohesive stresses are determined according the crack opening displacement. Linear, bi-linear and exponential cohesive laws are used to model the residual resistance of the cohesive zone. The results achieved by the proposed formulation are compared with experimental and numerical ones available in literature, in order to validate and prove its robustness and accuracy.}

A displacement approximation enrichment based on the Williams first-order expansions is used to represent the near-tip square root behavior predicted by the linear elastic fracture mechanics. This strategy also enables the direct evaluation of the Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs) after a crack tip tying constraint is enforced at the crack tip to accommodate the additional enrichment parameters. Additionally, discontinuous functions are embedded into the displacement approximation of elements intercepted by cracks to avoid remeshing of these elements. For the discontinuous enrichment, new equations are provided by imposing displacement continuity conditions at the crack mouth. Shifted enrichment functions are used to preserve the physical meaning of the nodal parameters and to reduce the singularity order of the integral kernels containing the enrichment terms in the XBEM formulation. Furthermore, an enriched traction approximation is proposed to apply concentrated forces and support points along the boundary. When considering the XBEM formulation, changes in the conventional BEM are minimal, which facilitates the implementation of the extended approach into existing codes. Three numerical examples demonstrate the application of the proposed XBEM formulation in fracture modeling."

NURBS basis functions are used for the domain and crack representation as well as to approximate the physical quantities involved in the simulations. A stable quadrature scheme for singular integration is proposed to enhance the robustness of the method in dealing with highly distorted elements. Convergence studies in the crack opening displacement is performed for a penny-shaped crack and an elliptical crack. Two approaches to extract stress intensity factors (SIFs): the contour M integral and the virtual crack closure integral are compared using dual integral equations.

The background of the developed method is to use non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) for the Galerkin approximation of both geometry and field variables (i.e.the displacement and traction on the boundary). The basic ingredient of the method is a pair of weakly-singular weak-form integral equations for the displacement and traction on the boundary. These integral equations contain at most weakly-singular kernels of lnr, where r is the distance from a source point to a field point. Various numerical examples are examined to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

The nonhomogeneous structural system is assumed as composed of piecewise homogeneous and isotropic materials. The high-cycle fatigue condition is assumed, which enables the use of the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). The mechanical behaviour is determined by the dual boundary element method (DBEM). The DBEM is a robust and efficient method for handling crack growth analyses because of the non-requirement of the domain mesh. This aspect enables the proper description of the elastic fields surrounding the crack tip. Moreover, it simplifies the remeshing procedures during the crack propagation. To couple adjacent materials forming the nonhomogeneous domain, the sub-region technique is used considering perfectly bonded interfaces. Regarding the fatigue, the crack growth rates are evaluated with the Paris' law. In addition, the structural life is assessed with a scheme based on discrete crack increments. The stress intensity factors at the crack tips are computed with the J-integral technique, whereas the crack propagation angle is defined with the LEFM theory. Four applications are presented to illustrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed numerical approach for the multiple fatigue crack propagation modelling.}

The boundary element method (BEM) requires only the bounding surface of geometries to be described; this makes non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS), which commonly describe the bounding curve or surface of geometries in CAD software, appear to be a natural tool for the approach. This isogeometric analysis BEM (IGABEM) provides accuracy benefits over conventional BEM schemes due to the analytical geometry provided by NURBS. When applied to wave problems, it has been shown that enriching BEM approximations with a partition-of-unity basis, in what has become known as the PU-BEM, allows highly accurate solutions to be obtained with a much reduced number of degrees of freedom. This paper combines these approaches and presents an extended isogeometric BEM (XIBEM) which uses partition-of-unity enriched NURBS functions; this new approach provides benefits which surpass those of both the IGABEM and the PU-BEM.

In a heterogeneous material, the crack tip stress field has a mixed-mode condition, and the crack growth path is affected by inhomogeneous materials and mixed-mode conditions. Stress intensity factors (SIFs) in the mixed-mode condition are evaluated using the virtual crack closure method (VCCM). The criteria for the crack growth amount and crack growth path are based on these SIFs, and the growing crack configurations are obtained. At first, the basic problem is solved, and the results are compared with some results available in the literature. It is shown that this system gives an adequate accurate estimation of the SIFs. Then, two-dimensional fatigue crack growth problems are simulated using this system. The first example is a plate with an interface between hard and soft materials. The cracks tend to grow in soft materials through the interface. A second example is a plate with distributed hard inclusions. The crack takes a zig-zag path by propagating around the hard inclusions. In each case, the crack growth path changes in a complicated manner. Changes of the SIFs values are also shown and discussed."

A two-field poromechanics problem is first recast as the twofold saddle point of an incremental energy functional. We then introduce Lagrange multipliers and compatibility energy functionals to enforce the weak compatibility of hydro-mechanical responses in the overlapped domain. To examine the numerical stability of this hydro-mechanical Arlequin model, we derive a necessary condition for stability, the twofold inf–sup condition for multi-field problems, and establish a modified inf–sup test formulated in the product space of the solution field. We verify the implementation of the Arlequin poromechanics model through benchmark problems covering the entire range of drainage conditions. Through these numerical examples, we demonstrate the performance, robustness, and numerical stability of the Arlequin poromechanics model. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this paper, one of the key features of the extended-finite element method, namely the heaviside enrichment function, is used within the Arlequin framework to further reduce the costs of crack propagation simulations. The main goal of the paper is to describe the proposed methodology and to assess its performance through numerical experiments."

The coupling is based on the Arlequin method which blends the energies of different scales in a so called “handshake domain”. To our knowledge, it is the first time that a three dimensional extended Arlequin method for fracture is reported for dynamic applications. To show the suitability of the proposed method, two crack problems with a very fine region around the crack front are solved. The results show that the method is capable of effectively coupling the two regions while having the same accuracy of the full scale model based on a very fine mesh."

A non-dimensional space is created and the relative curvature and fibers length are calculated for both reference and deformed configurations and used to calculate the strain energy at general points. The classical Newmark equations are used to integrate time. Damping is introduced into the mechanical system by a rheonomic energy functional. The final formulation has the advantage of being simple and easy to teach, when compared to classical counterparts. The behavior of a bench-mark problem (spin-up maneuver) is studied regarding the influence of mass representation on its overall transient and steady-state behavior.

For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order concept, k-refinement, is introduced. Refinements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a CAD (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-refinement strategy is shown to converge toward monotone solutions for advection–diffusion processes with sharp internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element analysis and possesses several advantages."

Appropriate integration path choices serve both to relate the integral to the near tip deformations and, in many cases, to permit its direct evaluation. This averaged measure of the near tip field leads to approximate solutions for several strain-concentration problems. Contained perfectly plastic deformation near a crack tip is analyzed for the plane-strain case with the aid of the slip-line theory. Near tip stresses are shown to be significantly elevated by hydrostatic tension, and a strain singularity results varying inversely with distance from the tip in centered fan regions above and below the tip. Approximate estimates are given for the strain intensity, plastic zone size, and crack tip opening displacement, and the important role of large geometry changes in crack blunting is noted. Another application leads to a general solution for crack tip separations in the Barenblatt-Dugdale crack model. A proof follows on the equivalence of the Griffith energy balance and cohesive force theories of elastic brittle fracture, and hardening behavior is included in a model for plane-stress yielding. A final application leads to approximate estimates of strain concentrations at smooth-ended notch tips in elastic and elastic-plastic materials.}",

This is very nearly the direction perpendicular to the maximum tangential stress at the crack tip, which is 70.5 deg. The hypothesis that the crack will grow in the direction perpendicular to the largest tension at the crack tip seems to be verified also by cracked plates under combined tension and shear. In spite of the fact that “sliding” and “tearing” modes of crack extension do not take place in brittle materials it is shown that one can still talk about critical stress intensity factors in plane shear and transverse bending of plates. It is also shown that, in general plane loading, the fracture criterion in terms of stress intensity factors is an ellipse.}",

This multiscale strategy consists of two techniques that the Nitsche’s method is applied for coupling different length-scales meshes on one hand, and on the other hand, a local enrichment technique is taken to describe the cracks independently of the mesh in the refined region by introducing the enrichment function into the isogeometric analysis displacement approximation. This method inherits the advantage of XIGA and simultaneously improves his limitation on the local mesh refinement. The proposed approach possesses several advantages in fracture modeling: (i) the singularities of the crack-tip fields can be captured precisely and conveniently by the enrichment techniques; (ii) higher-order convergence rates is achieved and (iii) stress smoothing results are achieved owing to higher continuity of NURBS basis functions. Numerical results of static and stationary dynamic crack problems validate its accuracy and efficiency."

abstract = {Many fluid flow problems involve localized effects within a larger flow domain, with boundary layers close to solid boundaries being one of the most common. Accurate and realistic computational analysis of such problems requires that the local flow behavior be properly represented by a numerical formulation with affordable computational cost. Among several strategies developed in the computational mechanics to deal with multiscale phenomena, the Arlequin method proposes overlapping a local discretization to a global one, in the neighborhood of localized effects, and gluing both models in an appropriate subzone of the overlap by means of Lagrange multipliers method, being successful in the solid mechanics context, but less explored in CFD analysis. To improve stability and conditioning of the algebraic system of equations and, at the same time ensure more flexibility, we propose a novel residual-based stabilized Arlequin formulation. Following, the proposed formulation is applied to the numerical analysis of incompressible flows. The resulting formulation is tested with selected numerical examples, considering structured and unstructured, coincident and non-coincident finite element discretization, Stokes problems and convection dominated Navier–Stokes problems, steady and transient cases, showing the methodology precision, robustness and flexibility.}

Composite grids use more than one grid to mesh an overall configuration with each individual subgrid of the system patched or overset together. Because each individual subgrid in the system is well ordered, the overall grid is suitable for efficient finite difference solution using vectorized or multitasking computers. Some of the advantages and difficulties of using various composite grid schemes are reviewed in this paper.}

The X-FEM allows one to use meshes not necessarily matching the physical surface of the problem while retaining the accuracy of the classical finite element approach. For material interfaces, this is achieved by introducing a new enrichment strategy. Although the mesh does not need to conform to the physical surfaces, it needs to be fine enough to capture the geometry of these surfaces. A simple algorithm is described to adaptively refine the mesh to meet this geometrical requirement. Numerical experiments on the periodic homogenization of two-phase complex cells demonstrate the accuracy and simplicity of the X-FEM.}

The development of the GFEM is illustrated for the Laplacian in two space dimensions in domains which may include several hundreds of voids, and/or cracks, for which the construction of meshes used by the FEM is practically impossible. The two main capabilities are: (1) It can construct the approximation using meshes which may overlap part, or all, of the domain boundary. (2) It can incorporate into the approximation handbook functions, which are known analytically, or are generated numerically, and approximate well the solution of the boundary value problem in the neighborhood of corner points, voids, cracks, etc. The main tool is a special integration algorithm, which we call the Fast Remeshing approach, which is robust and works for any domain with arbitrary complexity. The incorporation of the handbook functions into the GFEM is done by employing the partition of unity method (PUM). The presented formulations and implementations can be easily extended to the multi-material medium where the voids are replaced by inclusions of various shapes and sizes, and to the case of the elasticity problem. This work can also be understood as a pilot study for the feasibility and demonstration of the capabilities of the GFEM, which is needed before analogous implementations are attempted in the three-dmensional and nonlinear cases, which are the cases of main interest for future work.}

The strategy combines three-dimensional membrane elements (called active face) with solid prismatic elements. This approach is different from the usual ones that use solid elements to discretize all parts of a panel or use equivalent macroscopic properties to simulate honeycomb-shape laminated composites. In the proposed technique, the composition of elements is done by means of direct nodal correspondence, defined in the mesh generation procedure, not interfering in the number of degrees of freedom of the models. Thus, introduction of reinforcements does not increase the number of degrees of freedom, which makes the technique highly economical from the numerical point of view. Positional finite element (Positional FEM) procedure is adopted, resulting in a total Lagrangian description that allows general applications including large displacements of laminated plate and shell problems. Positional FEM adopts as main variables the current nodal positions instead of displacements as classical finite elements do. The proposed stiffening cell element is tested regarding stress and displacements calculations, comparing results with literature. Results for large displacements in reinforced honeycomb laminated shells are also presented.}

abstract={This paper deals with the general problem of crack extension in a combined stress field where a crack can grow in any arbitrary direction with reference to its original position. In a situation, when both of the stress-intensity factors,k1,k2 are present along the crack front, the crack may spread in any direction in a plane normal to the crack edge depending on the loading conditions. Preliminary results indicate that the direction of crack growth and fracture toughness for the mixed problem of Mode I and Mode II are governed by the critical value of the strain-energy-density factor,Scr. The basic assumption is that crack initiation occurs when the interior minimum ofS reaches a critical value designatedScr. The strain-energy-density factorS represents the strength of the elastic energy field in the vicinity of the crack tip which is singular of the order of 1/r where the radial distancer is measured from the crack front. In the special case of Mode I crack extensionScr is related tok1c alone asScr = ($\kappa$ − 1)k12/8$\mu$. In general,S takes the quadratic forma1 1k1 + 2a1 2k1k2 +a2 2k2 whose critical value is assumed to be a material constant. The analytical predictions are in good agreement with experimental data on the problem of an inclined crack in plexiglass and aluminum alloy specimens. The result of this investigation provides a convenient procedure for determining the critical crack size that a structure will tolerate under mixed mode conditions for a given applied stress.},

Résumé
On établit l'utilité de la méthode de l'élément fini pour les calculs des facteurs d'intensité de la tension de rupture en bout. Bien qu'habituellement les méthodes d'éléments finis ne peuvent pas représenter la singularité de la force de rupture en bout, il est possible d'obtenir par un procédé simple des valeurs significatives de ces facteurs d'intensité. Les résultats sont comparés à ceux des autres solutions analytiques, et une corrélation supplémentaire est effectuée avec types spécimens différents d'essai de rupture.
Zusammenfassung
Die Zweckmässigkeit der Methode der endlichen Elemente für die Errechnung von Spannungsfaktoren an Rissspitzen wird dargelegt. Obzwar die gewöhnlichen Methoden der endlichen Elemente nicht imstande sind die Singularität der Rissspitzenspannung vorzustellen, können mittels eines einfachen Verfahrens doch sinnvolle Werte für Spannungsfaktoren an den Rissspitzen erhalten werden. Die Ergebnisse werden nicht nur mit den Ergebnissen anderer analytischer Lösungen verglichen, sondern es wird auch eine zusätzliche Korrelation von zwei verschiedenen Typen von Bruchprobekörpern vorgenommen."

Such formulation is different from the traditional finite element approach used in fluid dynamics by using current nodal positions as main variable instead of nodal velocities. The variational form of the governing equations is derived by applying the stationary total mechanical energy principle written in terms of current positions. To introduce full incompressibility, we use equal-order mixed finite elements combined to a pressure stabilizing Petrov-Galerkin technique, circumventing Ladyzhenskaya-Babuška-Brezzi conditions. This leads to a method directly applicable to finite strain incompressible flow problems that, if combined to re-meshing techniques, is capable of simulating more complex problems, resulting into a suitable tool for free-surface flows analysis in general. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with numerical studies and comparison of obtained results to numerical and experimental data from literature."

This improvement is important when an initial simple fluid velocity field cannot replace embedded shell movements, or when the shell closure changes position in a way that large rotations are present. The proposed formulation does not use the concept of rotations, resulting in an algorithm that conserves linear and angular momentum for large rigid body displacements when using the well established Newmark time integrator. Other advantages of this formulation are the use of complete stress–strain relations and the possibility of solving thin or thick shells developing large displacements and small strains. Numerical examples are presented in order to validate the proposed shell formulation regarding FSI applications."

The structure is modelled using a novel finite element method formulation for geometric non-linear shell dynamics. Such shell formulation, so-called positional formulation, is based on the minimum potential energy theorem, written regarding nodal positions and generalised unconstrained vectors, not displacements and rotations. These characteristics avoid the use of large rotation approximations. The coupling between the two different meshes is done by mapping the fluid boundary nodes local positions over the shell elements and vice versa, avoiding the need for matching fluid and shell nodes. The fluid mesh is adapted using a simple approach based on shell positions and velocities. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by examples."

abstract={One of the most employed strategies in finite element analysis of fluid--structure interaction (FSI) problems involves using an arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian (ALE) method for the fluid, requiring an additional step to the partitioned coupling algorithm: the dynamic mesh moving. Mesh moving techniques need to avoid excessive element distortion or inversion. In this work, we develop a partitioned FSI algorithm for large displacement shell structures-incompressible flow interaction analysis using the finite element method (FEM). The coupling is performed by a block Gauss--Seidel implicit approach and the fluid mesh is updated by a linear Laplacian smoothing. To save computing time and avoid element inversion during the mesh deformation procedure, we introduce a coarse higher-order auxiliary mesh, which is used only to capture the structural deformation and extend it to the fluid domain. The shell structure is modeled by a FEM formulation with nodal positions and components of an unconstrained vector as degrees of freedom, which avoids the need for dealing with large rotations approximations. We solve the fluid dynamics equations in the ALE description using an implicit time marching temporal integrator and stabilized mixed FEM spatial discretization. Finally, the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are tested with numerical examples compared to the literature results.},

abstract={In this work, we develop a position-based finite element formulation for elasto-plastic solids under contact situation. The proposed positional formulation employs a total Lagrangian description and naturally considers geometric nonlinearities. The employed elasto-plastic model is derived from the dissipation inequality, using the thermodynamic conjugacy between the plastic strain rate and the so-called Mandel stress. The formulation is based on the Kr{\"o}ner--Lee decomposition, in which the deformation gradient is multiplicatively split into its elastic and plastic parts. We apply the backward Euler method to solve the plastic evolutions and von Mises yield criterion to define the elastic limit. The adopted kinematic hardening model is a finite strain generalization of the Armstrong--Frederick law, which uses the objective Jaumann derivative for the evolution equation and the concept of back stress tensor as an internal variable. For the elastic parcel of strains, we adopt a neo-Hookean constitutive law. With respect to the 2D application, plane strain and plane stress approximations are considered, where the latter is solved numerically by a local Newton--Raphson numerical procedure. Regarding the contact problem, a classical node-to-segment algorithm is applied, considering both frictionless and frictional cases, with the introduction of Lagrange multipliers in order to enforce contact constraints. Representative numerical examples are used to validate and show the possibilities of the proposed formulation in macroscale simulation of metal cold forming manufacturing processes.},

The nonhomogeneous structural system is assumed as composed of piecewise homogeneous and isotropic materials. The high-cycle fatigue condition is assumed, which enables the use of the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). The mechanical behaviour is determined by the dual boundary element method (DBEM). The DBEM is a robust and efficient method for handling crack growth analyses because of the non-requirement of the domain mesh. This aspect enables the proper description of the elastic fields surrounding the crack tip. Moreover, it simplifies the remeshing procedures during the crack propagation. To couple adjacent materials forming the nonhomogeneous domain, the sub-region technique is used considering perfectly bonded interfaces. Regarding the fatigue, the crack growth rates are evaluated with the Paris' law. In addition, the structural life is assessed with a scheme based on discrete crack increments. The stress intensity factors at the crack tips are computed with the J-integral technique, whereas the crack propagation angle is defined with the LEFM theory. Four applications are presented to illustrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed numerical approach for the multiple fatigue crack propagation modelling."

The membrane material is modelled using standard large strain hyperelastic constitutive equations. The volume of fluid is obtained by integrating over the membrane surface and Boyle's law is used to determine the changes in air pressure that result from changes in volume. Full linearization of the internal pressure forces and the resulting additional term in the tangent operator are derived.

It was shown that the crack tip location has a significant effect on the magnitude and sign of geometry factors but the shape of aggregates had no sound influence on both modes I and II stress intensity factors. Geometry factors obtained from heterogeneous modeling (i.e. two-phase aggregate/mastic asphalt mixture) when the crack tip is located inside the aggregates were greater than those obtained from homogeneous model. On the other hand, if the crack tip is located inside the mastic part, the geometry factors will be smaller than the homogeneous SCB model.

It was shown that the aggregates could change the crack growth path locally; however, the general direction of crack growth in heterogeneous and homogeneous modeling is the same."
